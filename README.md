# C Programming Practice

This repository contains my personal C programming practice while building strong foundations in:

- Control flow
- Functions
- Arrays & strings
- Pointers (basics)
- Problem-solving in C

The code reflects continuous learning and improvement.
More structured refactoring and advanced topics will be added over time.
